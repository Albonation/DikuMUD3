Anyone: I really need someone dilligent that loves spells to go through all the spells and make 
        sure they have reasonable restrictions. Personally, I like MAG / DIV restrictions better
		than level.

fireweapon and missile - how do they work and how does identify work?

Maybe: Fix ships (it's dark and they all run their own code) and make them transparent 

Test XP works as expected.
Test play

Fizz: Working on converting justice.cpp to DIL. IN progress.
Converting justice.cpp to DIL would be amazing. The last terrible bug I found was there (took 1+ week to find).

I would like the following cleaned up for a distro:
   (It's really there because Valhalla has been growing and spurting for 25 years and 
    trying to support veteran players that are level 65,000 :-)))

	Professions
		Maybe change "Dark Knight" to Barbarian. DK is really just an evil paladin. Guild determines?
		Maybe change Conjurer to Bard to have a thief / mage prof. Mage and COnjurer are just variants based on guild.
		Or add the two.
		Need to go through most Professions and get them steamlined in tune with what players would expect
		they seem quite messy at the time of writing

	Revise the guild teachers in guilddef.h so they actually teach what is reasonable.
	Maybe if the teacher 

Suggests plan to revise data and points and start sequence:

   0) It would be good with a brief summary of each profession
        Is a fighter generally good with almost all melee weapons ?
		Is a Paladin mostly good with Swords & 2H swords? The they use battle axes?
		Are Knights also using huge battle axes?
	  Just so there is a basic consensus. For example, right now I think
	  it is incredibly odd that the fighter was unable to practice most
	  weapons. I think it might be fine that a whip, rapier, stiletto is
	  less for a fighter and more for someone more dexterous and less strong,
	  e.g. thieves and assassins, maybe rangers.

	I suggest we add these to the Wiki and get it described at least at a core
	level. Not too long :)

   1) Revise the ability costs:
   		- profession practice costs in skills.cpp
        - Revise etc/ability.def racial modifiers

   2) Revise basis.zon playerinit() DIL
        - the assigned abilities based on race 
		- the ability + based on profession.
		(will +4 MAG with -5 MOD give -1?)

Could add frenzy skill (would be a blast)

MS: Ken mentioned light issues. Check value overrun. It's a known bug.
MS: Performance of DIL. wander_zones would benefit from being ported to C :o)
