Anyone: I really need someone dilligent that loves spells to go through all the spells and make 
        sure they have reasonable restrictions. Personally, I like MAG / DIV restrictions better
		than level.

fireweapon and missile - how do they work and how does identify work?

Maybe: Fix ships (it's dark and they all run their own code) and make them transparent 

Test XP works as expected.
Test play
