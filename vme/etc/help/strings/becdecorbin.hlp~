At first glance, a bec de corbin might be mistaken for a Lucern hammer,<br/>
but important functional differences can be noted. The bec de corbin was<br/>
used late in the Middle Ages by knights and nobles, not by commoners.<br/>
Its heavy, crow's-beak blade was designed to puncture the heavy plate<br/>
armor common to upper-class warriors. In this weapon the beak is the<br/>
major feature. This is backed by a flat hammer head, or by a clawed head<br/>
somewhat similar to that of a Lucern hammer, and the end spike is more<br/>
bladelike and far shorter than the awl spike of the Lucern hammer, for<br/>
the latter weapon was not so specialized. <br/>
