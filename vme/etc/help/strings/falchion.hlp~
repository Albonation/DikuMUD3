A European descendant of the Egyptian khopesh and Greek kopis designs, the<br/>
falchion had a broad blade, thick along the spine and sharpened on the convex<br/>
curve of the blade. Used primarily for slashing and chopping, some falchions<br/>
also had a point which could be used for thrusting. As blades became smaller<br/>
from the 16th century on, the falchion design developed into the saber.<br/>
