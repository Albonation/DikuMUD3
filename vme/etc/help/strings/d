<br/>
Valhalla is basically free to play, but we do appreciate your donation<br/>
showing your appreciation for the huge amount of work which has gone<br/>
into making this the best mud ever.<br/><br/><br/>
<br/>
A donation of just $30 or more per year will allow you access to *all* areas<br/>
of Valhalla (without the donation your selection of area is limited<br/>
but the game is still free of charge).<br/><br/><br/>
<br/>
You are also able to show your appreciation of our work by bribing us<br/>
into giving you certain benefits. For example, you can get your own<br/>
temple constructed, get your name ingraved on a stone tablet or buy<br/>
special skills and benefits. See 'help bribes' for additional<br/>
information.<br/>
