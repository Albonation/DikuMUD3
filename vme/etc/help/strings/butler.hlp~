Just as is required for the architechtural design of the house, a lot<br/>
of work must go into the design of the interior. For every object or<br/>
person you want in your house, you must fill out the following:<br/>
<br/>
names<br/>
  For example: "james", "butler"<br/>
<br/>
description<br/>
  For example: James is standing here greeting you with a friendly smile.<br/>
<br/>
extra:<br/>
  For example: James is a charming young man, dressed in bla bla.<br/>
<br/>
where:<br/>
  What room this object is to be placed in.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore you must specify if your house contains any doors, and<br/>
possibly any keys. Because of the considerable amount of time it takes<br/>
for us to implement the house, you should count on a $2 - $5 bribe<br/>
per object or person in your house. With a house of 2 or more rooms<br/>
you get one door for free.<br/>
