Armors are used to protect yourself against damage.<br/>
Shields are an addition to armors which makes it possible to<br/>
completely block certain types of attacks and spells like for<br/>
example long sword attack and energy bolt. Some attacks are<br/>
partially reduced by shields, such as the morning star, and<br/>
fire storm. Finally, some attacks are unaffected by shields<br/>
such as a whip and poisonous gas attacks.<br/>
