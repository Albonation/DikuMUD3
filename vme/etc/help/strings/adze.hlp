The adze was a traditional carpenter’s tool with a long thin<br/>
axe-like blade attached at a right angle to the handle; they<br/>
were used for cutting grooves. The Maori of New Zealand used<br/>
adzes (called a toki) as war weapons. Theirs were carved of<br/>
bone or jade, usually decorated very elaborately, and lashed<br/>
to a wooden handle.<br/>
