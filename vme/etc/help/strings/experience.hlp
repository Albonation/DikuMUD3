Experience is usually gained by killing monsters. The experience you gain is<br/>
relative to your level compared to the monsters level.<br/>
<br/><br/>
You gain no experience when killing players.<br/><br/>
If you are in wimpy mode you'll only gain 50%<br/><br/>
If you are good and kill evil you get a bonus. Vice versa but not as large.<br/><br/>
